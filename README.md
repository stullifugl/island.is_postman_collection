# island.is_postman_collection

Postman collection generator for island.is authentication customers

This repo is a simulation for an extension idea to the application for giving customers access to the authentication system.

From the application, the program will get data and update the standard postman collection with their own values

This process is simulated in a python program in this repo but the idea is to add it to the process the application is made in and send the updated postman collection to
the users

To simulate the process add your own variable values to the file variables.txt
Only change the values on the right side of the character ':'

Once you have done that you can run the python program by opening a shell of your choosing with the following command

**py replace_variables.py**
